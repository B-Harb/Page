<p style="font-family:Courier; color:White; font-size: 14px;">
The role is described as a Control Systems/Automation Engineer. With a focus on projects, variety and new changing subject matter. Electrical design is a component of the role in addition to the development of control systems equipment and interfaces such as HMI, SCADA and PLC development, FAT Testing, commissioning of works and control systems for clientele. The role is described as being largely autonomous with group and individual projects. Travel availability is mentioned for a specific area across Sydney, and rare travel further a field is also indicated.
  <br>
Requirements are 2 years experience integrating projects with PLC’s and developing SCADA application. With the ability to learn fast, communicate well, leadership for design progression, ability to read electrical schematics and code, and a knowledge of safety circuits. Commissioning experience in a lead capacity is expected.
  <br>
In summary the personal qualities the role denotes of value are organisation and personality, interest in control systems, and a self drive within this field.

  Equipment is a key focus for this role. </p>

<p style="font-family:Courier; color:White; font-size: 14px;">This role appeals to myself as it describes the niche, I’ve always taken an interest in with regards to control systems enabling designed infrastructure to Operate as intended. There are standards to these expectations essential to how effective a project is. FAT testing is Factory Acceptance Testing. This evaluation is incredibly important in commissioning works with the intent of confirming the operation is in accordance with design specifications. In a time where safety and risk are managed through intensive engineering controls such as interlocks. To conduct this important element of work is a great responsibility, analytical and requires thorough involvement. The outcome from which can directly affect the relationship between the integrator and the client. A lot of verification following creation is a required focus of this role which involves technical, electrical engineering and design knowledge and experience.

There are a number of elements required for the advertised role that I do not yet possess. My personal characteristics align; However, I have only user experience with certain Siemens products. The remaining focus equipment utilised by the role are elements I would gain exposure to through job placement where this equipment is utilised. External study within engineering with a focus on applications such as AutoCad. Additionally, courses in specific applications and equipment are available to join to further develop my exposure while I attempt to obtain experience. My exposure to projects has been informative however my time leading such ventures has been minimal. I would require more project delivery experience to feel an appropriate applicant in addition to a successful one in response to this advert. While I use electrical, design and mechanical drawings already, I feel I would need further growth in this area also. Control Systems roles which work around Automation generally require some engineering knowledge and or education. I feel as though this limits me compared to someone who was an electrician before becoming an electrical engineer. There is a large area of knowledge I would benefit from if I took on some electrical engineering courses. Mechatronics would prove most useful. So to would specific coding language experience of education before success in the chosen role would be not only appropriate but granted.
