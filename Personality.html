  <p style="font-family:Courier; color:White; font-size: 19x;"> Myers Briggs Test Result <p>

  <p style="font-family:Courier; color:White; font-size: 14px;"> According to an online Myers-Briggs Personality Test my personality type is ISTJ which is an acronym for Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, Judging.
The characteristics of this profile are:
An honest and direct individual, who is decisive, efficient and systematic. Dedicated and responsible in nature with a strong will. Who is Organised, reliable and values tradition and stability. Highly committed and trustworthy character. It is quoted that ISTJ’s make up about 9% of the population.

<p style="font-family:Courier; color:White; font-size: 19px;"> What do the Results of these tests mean for myself?
   <br>
<p style="font-family:Courier; color:White; font-size: 14px;">There is very little affect the results from participating in the tests above have on myself. I understand that employers utilise these systems and either through the use of heuristics or the personality profile specifically, achieve employment outcomes. If I am not a particular design by the results then I may not be perceived as a suitable fit for a role. I have no influence over this. I may merely partake in the employment processes and be genuine to myself. I can accept that I may not be successful based on my individuality. I say this as regardless of how one perceives themselves and how they answer a test. Their assigned qualities do not necessarily reflect how they undertake relationships, productivity and professional requirements. I speak from experience. I have always been considered to possess some form of introversion (if we are to refer to a concept born in the 1970’s). However, regardless of discomfort to partake in activities that appear to stretch my profile outside it’s bounds. I do so. To be comfortable can equate to a stagnate state. I have encountered the best growth, challenges, and accomplishments. In addition to forming healthy relationships when I have extended myself outside what I may be profiled. Respectfully, I do not subscribe to boundaries of such tangent detail. For if I did, I would feel restricted by it. If I can highlight this further, I have real life experience where a past supervisor wasn’t sure about the decision he made regarding my successful employment as I seemed switched on and accurate, yet quiet. He had concerns about my gentler character in such a male dominated workplace. That I would be silenced among the crowd. This was far from the result as I moved on to leading the group through large projects through a communication style I created within the group. I needn’t be louder. I needed to understand how my peers worked and communicate in a way that was best understood and rallied behind by all. An important component of a pre employment personality test is how the culture of an organisation may be showcased by the personalities perceived suitable. As a prospective employee a successful test and placement may be indicative of the company’s culture. An additional factor when considering if the place of employment is suitable for the employee.

 <br> 
 As mentioned, there is no real influence on my behaviours within a team. How I am within myself is vastly different to what is necessary and for the success of a team. I will as always extend myself to learn and understand the team members I’m working with to ensure a collaborative experience as goals are developed an achieved. I am highly aware of my area of influence and I can only do my best to understand the variances of others so that I may understand how we will mould as a team.
